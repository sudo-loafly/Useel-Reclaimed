# Quick Note
Useel is a (**CSS**/**SCSS**) framework developed and worked on by GeoneveStudios for 6 months; But due to problems... Better left unsaid they gave it to me. So, I will now continue to work on Useel.

# Useel Configuration
Useel is now configurated with **TokeScript** & **C++**.. (**Notice**) for those of you who don't know what the **configuration** of **useel** is. The languages `C++` & `TokeScript` both run on the server. Which allows useel to run faster. So, without `TokeScript, C++` **useel would be much less responsive**!

###### The following down below is an example of TokeScript Configuration;
```ts
let use = this.Variable;
if (this.viewport exceeds this.width * this.height()) {
  this.Document(( cookiegem.keep({
    use this.Compress.ViewportSize.X;
    use this.Compress.ViewportSize.Y;
  })
});
```

# Future Updates
Not that many in mind infact. Because;

## Useel-Website
This idea is already being worked upon this very moment: [Replit Website](https://useel.spacies.repl.co).
