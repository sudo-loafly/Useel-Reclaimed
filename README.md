# Quick Note
Useel is a (**CSS**/**SCSS**) framework developed and worked on by GeoneveStudios for 6 months; But due to problems... Better left unsaid they gave it to me. So, I will now continue to work on Useel.

Useel is now configurated with **TokeScript** & **C++**.. (**Notice**) for those of you who don't know what the **configuration** of **useel** is.
